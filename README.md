# Installation

## Installing Galaxy Dependencies

In order to use this pipeline, you will also have to install the [kraken2][] and [bracken][] Galaxy tools and their data 
managers within your Galaxy instance. These can be found at:

| Name                               | Version               | Revision                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kraken2                            | `2.1.1+galaxy1`       | [`e674066930b2`](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/kraken2/e674066930b2)             |
| bracken                            | `2.6.1+galaxy0`       | [`b08ac10aed96`](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/bracken/b08ac10aed96)             |
| data_manager_build_kraken2_database| `2.1.1`               | [`2f27f3b86827`](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/data_manager_build_kraken2_database/2f27f3b86827) |
| data_manager_build_bracken_database| `2.5.1+galaxy1`       | [`3c7d2c84cb09`](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/data_manager_build_bracken_database/3c7d2c84cb09) |

## Preparing Databases

This pipeline requires databases for kraken2 and bracken to be installed in Galaxy. The Galaxy admin can do this using the `data_manager_build_kraken2_database` and
`data_manager_build_bracken_database` tools that are listed above.

In the Galaxy 'Admin' panel, select 'Local Data' from the left-side menu:

![installation-local-data][]

### Preparing the Kraken2 Database

On the 'Local Data' page, select 'Kraken2 database builder' from the 'Installed Data Managers' list:

![installation-local-data-kraken2-builder][]

Choose the type of Kraken2 database to install. For most analyses, the 'Standard' database is recommended. For reproducibility and standardization, using a
'pre-built' database is recommended. Pre-built databases are downloaded from Ben Langmead's '[Index Zone](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2)'. To get the very latest sequences
from RefSeq, a Standard database can be built locally. Note that building a standard kraken2 database is a computationally resource-intensive job. Consult the
[kraken2 docs](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual) for details.

![installation-local-data-kraken2-builder-db-type][]

If a pre-built database type is selected, choose the size of database to download. Larger databases contain more detailed information and are able to correctly assign reads to a greater
variety of species. Note that the entire database will be loaded into system RAM during analysis. Ensure that your system can support the database before downloading.

![installation-local-data-kraken2-builder-db-size][]

If a pre-built database is selected, choose the build date for the database. The most recent build date is generally preferred.

![installation-local-data-kraken2-builder-db-date][]

Click the 'Execute' button to begin downloading (or building) the Kraken2 database. The download or build process may take significant time, depending on system resources. When complete, the
Kraken2 job in the Galaxy History panel will turn green:

![installation-local-data-kraken2-builder-db-complete][]

### Preparing the Bracken Database

On the 'Local Data' page, select 'Bracken database builder' from the 'Installed Data Managers' list:

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder][]

Each bracken database corresponds to a specific Kraken2 database. Select the Kraken2 database that was installed in the previous section.

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder-kraken-db][]

If the Kraken2 database selected in the step above is a pre-built database, select 'Yes'. If it was locally-built, select 'No':

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder-kraken-db-prebuilt][]

Each bracken database is configured for a specific read length. All pre-built Kraken2 databased from the [Index Zone](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2)
come bundled with a set of Bracken databases for a variety of read lengths. Select the read length that is appropriate for your dataset:

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder-read-length][]

If necessary, additional bracken databases can be built based on the same kraken2 database, but with different read lengths. This may be necessary if some of your samples were
sequenced with read length of 150, and others with read length of 250, for example.

Give your bracken database a name. This is a free-text field, and it will be presented to the IRIDA user when they are asked to select a bracken database to use for their analysis.
Give the bracken database a name that clearly indicates which kraken2 database it corresponds to, and which read length it is configured for.

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder-name][]

Click the 'Execute' button to begin building the bracken database. If a pre-built Kraken2 database was selected, this step should complete quickly. When complete, the
Bracken Database Builder job in the Galaxy History panel will turn green:

![installation-local-data-bracken-builder-db-complete][]

## Installing to IRIDA

Please download the provided `irida-plugin-species-abundance-[version].jar` from the [releases](https://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/irida-plugin-species-abundance/releases)
page and copy to your  `/etc/irida/plugins` directory.  Now you may start IRIDA and you should see the pipeline appear in your list of pipelines.

*Note:* This plugin requires you to be running IRIDA version >= `21.01`. Please see the [IRIDA documentation](https://phac-nml.github.io/irida-documentation/developer/tools/pipelines/) for more details.

# Usage

The plugin should now show up in the **Analyses > Pipelines** section of IRIDA.

![plugin-pipeline.png][]  

## Analysis Results

You should be able to run a pipeline with this plugin and get analysis results. The results include a `kraken2` taxonomic
classification report, and a `bracken` estimate of the relative abundance of reads from each species in your sample.

![plugin-results.png][]

## Metadata Table

And, you should be able to save and view these results in the IRIDA metadata table. The following fields are written to
the IRIDA 'Line List':

| Field Name                           | Description                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `species-abundance/taxonomy_level`   | The taxonomic level at which reads were aggregated ('S' for species)                |
| `species-abundance/taxon_name`       | The scientific name of the most abundant species in the sample                      |
| `species-abundance/taxonomy_id`      | The NCBI taxonomy ID for the most abundant species in the sample                    |
